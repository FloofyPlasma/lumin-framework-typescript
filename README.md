This repo serves as an example for using lumin/framework with typescript.

>[!CAUTION]
> This isn't fully plug and play and requires a bit of setup.
> I'm going to assume you have node and the bunch installed already

> [!WARNING]
> My fork of the lumin framework has a lot of breaking changes as I just wanted to get a prototype together as quickly as possible. Expect existing code to not work.

## Instructions

1. [Grab the latest release of my fork of the framework here](https://github.com/FloofyPlasma/framework/releases)
2. Drop the tgz into the root folder of this repo
3. `npm i` and it should unpack lumin automatically, if it doesn't use `npm i rbxts-lumin-framework-9.1.1.tgz`
4. `npm run watch` and make any changes you wish
5. Connect the project to studio using `rojo serve` or the vsc extension
